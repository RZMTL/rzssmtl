Chapter 4: "Saria Featherrun & Hildea Featherrun"

"... All that was found in the burnt ruins were the bare minimum of remnants." Speaking in a low voice, Sithonia spread it out on the table in the dining hall. Wrapped in a white cloth, it was a strange object, blackened and charred. At first glance, it was difficult to understand what it was, but as they observed its burnt smell and shape, understanding gradually caught up. It was a part of a human bone, belonging to one of their sisters.

―― The transformed figure of Dorothea Featherrun.

"This is... Dorothea?" Ornia exclaimed in shock as she picked up the bone fragments on the cloth, her cheeks tense. Sithonia remained silent, not uttering a word in response to Ornia's suppressed emotions. However, that silence affirmed the undeniable truth. Their timid sister with blue hair had been discovered as a tragic charred corpse.

"What could have happened to Dorothea? Hildea is worried," Saria said.

"Saria seems to be grieving too. What happened to Dorothea?" Hildea added.

Even Saria and Hildea, who usually immersed themselves in their own world, were visibly pale-faced in the face of this situation. The tragedy that had befallen the "Featherrun sisters" was immense. The sisters were beings who had acquired a semblance of immortality. It shouldn't have been so easy for them to be killed.

"Even when facing high-ranking temple knights, it's unlikely that they would be so easily killed. So why did this happen?" Sithonia pondered.

"There's one possibility. If the other party knew how to kill the 'cursed dolls,'" she said.

"――! Could it be, the culprit is..." Ornia's expression changed drastically as she raised her head. Staring directly at her sister, Sithonia sighed heavily. There was only one person who could be responsible for killing Dorothea.

"――Elsa," Saria and Hildea's voices overlapped as they uttered the name.

Elsa, a member of the "Featherrun sisters"――or rather, someone who used to be a sister. She killed Holosseo and fled from the Featherrun mansion, and now she had killed Dorothea.

Why on earth did she need to do such a thing?

"Hehe... Is that girl planning to kill Hildea and the others too?"

"She's an outrageous girl. To think she would want to exterminate Saria and the others."

"Hold on! As hasty as it may sound, there must be another answer! I can't think of anyone other than her who could have killed Dorothea..."

Ornia tried to refute with determination, but Sithonia stopped her by restraining the twins who were about to confront the opponent head-on. Yet, even with the twins' cold gaze and Sithonia's words of "no," Ornia persisted.

Looking down at the bone fragments on the table and the lifeless body of Dorothea, Sithonia spoke while contemplating the situation.

"After our father, now Dorothea has been killed. It's natural to think that Elsa's aim is to exterminate all of us," Sithonia stated.

"Is she capable of thinking that far ahead!?" Hildea exclaimed.

"That might have been part of her act as well. How well do we really know Elsa? And if our lives are the target..." Saria added.

"She might have someone working for her," Hildea suggested.

"There seem to be many people who dislike the role of the 'Featherrun sisters,'" Sithonia remarked.

Saria and Hildea joined hands and supplemented Sithonia's opinion. With a half-closed eye in response to their accurate observations, Sithonia nodded towards Ornia.

However, Ornia attempted to argue against something.

"Ornia, I know that you had expectations for Elsa. But don't turn away from what has happened. ――Dorothea was killed by Elsa."

"G-guh..."

"As you said, this is not something Elsa could plan alone. There must be collaborators and someone giving orders. Unless we expose them, we won't find a fundamental solution."

Sithonia placed her hand on her forehead, acknowledging the presence of an enemy, and sighed.

Already, they were trying to conceal Holosseo's death and maintain the appearance of the Featherrun family. In such a situation, losing Dorothea was too painful. Both in terms of sheer combat strength and the bond between sisters.

Dorothea had desperately tried to protect the unity of the sisters, even if her affection for Holosseo outweighed her feelings for her sisters.

"――Hey, Sithonia. Regarding Elsa, could you leave it to Hildea and the others?"

"――Hey, Sithonia. Regarding Elsa, could you leave it to Saria and the others?"

The twins almost simultaneously made their suggestions, causing Sithonia to momentarily delay her response.

It was a surprising proposal. Considering that the twins would usually observe quietly even in such a situation, for them to take the initiative and assert themselves.

"Why are you two taking action? What's going on?" Ornia asked in disbelief.

"Well, Ornia, you're being too harsh. Hildea is also a member of the sisters, you know?"

"Saria also has her own thoughts. Ornia, you have a sharp tongue."

Ornia pouted in dissatisfaction, rubbing her cheeks against each other, while the twins confidently defended their position. Seizing the opportunity, Sithonia clasped her hands in front of her chest.

Regardless, Sithonia and Ornia were occupied with their role as the "Featherrun sisters."

"If you can fill in that gap that we can't reach, it would be a wish come true. But what will you do?"

"Well, leave that to Hildea."

"If it's Saria, it'll be a piece of cake."

After contemplating for a moment, Sithonia nodded in agreement.

Even though they lived in a closed-off world, they were also the "Featherrun sisters." They had never fallen behind in their duties, and their mental agility was twice as sharp.

"Is there anything you need?"

"No, we don't need anything. Hildea and I will take care of it ourselves."

"Oh, but maybe we could take a few things from Saria and the others?"

Saying that, the twins simultaneously pointed below their feet—or rather, even lower.

"We'll take all the mansion's dogs out. Of course, including the biggest one."

"And also, Sithonia... No, there's something I want Father to do."

Saria and Hildea wore sadistic smiles as they made the request to Sithonia. Sensing the twins' genuine determination hidden behind their smiles, Sithonia nodded quietly.

If it was necessary to kill Elsa, the one who had killed their father and sister, they would do whatever it took.

"Use whatever you need. But remember, failure is not an option."

----
"Ah..."

"――――"

As Elsa looked at what was being presented before her, an unusual confusion creased her brow.

It had been a few days since the incident with Dorothea was settled. She had returned to Oliver's base as if nothing had happened, spending time healing the wounds of battle. She sat on the floor, leaning against the bed, when something was offered to her—a single white flower. And the one holding it, gazing at Elsa, was a young girl named Tatiana.

Tatiana, the slave girl who had suffered under the deceased Haken and escaped back to Oliver's side. Or rather, now that she had returned, should she be referred to as a mere commodity rather than a slave?

In any case, Elsa had no intention of getting deeply involved with her, and she had never had a proper conversation with Tatiana, who had become mute. But...

"Why a flower, though?"

"Umm..."

"I don't understand 'ah' or 'umm.' I just think the flower is very beautiful."

Reluctantly shaking her head, Elsa tilted her head in confusion at Tatiana, who had limited means of expressing her thoughts. How did Oliver communicate with her in this state?

"She wants you to accept it. It should be obvious just by looking at it."

At that moment, just as Elsa was pondering such questions, the voice of the central figure of her curiosity trembled through her eardrums.

Oliver, having returned to his own bedroom, gazed at Elsa and Tatiana sitting across from each other on the floor. He shrugged his shoulders as if to say, "Oh well," and spoke.

"That girl is grateful to you. After I told her that you punished the wicked master who had treated Tatiana so cruelly..."

"So, she's grateful to me? Is this flower meant to convey that sentiment?"

"――――"

Tatiana vigorously nodded in response to Elsa's words. Then, comparing the flower held out before her and Tatiana herself, Elsa let out a sigh.

She gently accepted the flower from Tatiana's hand and said, "Thank you. I may not be thrilled, but I'll express my gratitude."

"Why can't you just be genuinely happy about it? Why do you speak like that?"

"I'm being honest with myself. Use it as a sales pitch the next time you try to sell me."

Saying that with an indifferent expression, Elsa gazed at the flower she had received.

It was a small, white wildflower. It had nothing remarkable about it, but in the frigid Gusteko Holy Kingdom, even an ordinary wildflower blooming was rare. Unlike cultivated flowers, wildflowers couldn't survive without the right conditions. This flower was a rare bloom.

"But even so, it ended up here with me... an unlucky flower."

"I've never seen anyone lament the misfortune of a flower... Honestly, if you had just shown some genuine happiness, Tatiana's efforts would have been worthwhile. Don't you think it's beautiful?"

"Oh, didn't I say it? I do think the flower is beautiful. And I do have some attachment to it."

As she said that, Elsa beckoned to Tatiana with her hand. Tatiana widened her eyes and timidly approached Elsa on the floor, emitting a soft purr.

Elsa gently extended her hand, holding the flower, towards Tatiana and said, "Here. It'll be more comfortable for the flower to be with you."

"Ah..."

The whimper that followed from Tatiana seemed to carry astonishment and admiration.

Tatiana widened her eyes, touched her own head—where Elsa had placed the white flower, turning it into an ornament—and seemed to be deeply moved by something.

Upon seeing that, Elsa nodded and then looked at Oliver.

"I was wondering how you communicate with this child, but it seems you surprisingly understand what she's thinking," Oliver said.

"...That's called empathy. So, what is she thinking now?"

"Well... She says she's hungry and wants you to make something, Oliver."

"Well, isn't that your sentiment! I should have had a higher opinion of you! I underestimated you!"

Oliver yelled after being stood up, and Elsa thought he was being noisy. Then, Elsa suddenly felt a weight on her shoulder.

"Ugh."

When she looked, she saw Tatiana resting her head on Elsa's shoulder, closing her eyes and growling softly. Elsa tilted her head, thinking it might be an act of intimidation or a display of dominance, but she realized it wasn't.

Tatiana's profile showed complete relief, and there was no trace of hostility.

"So, she chose to be attached to the person she shouldn't trust the most..."

"Oliver, what happened to the meal?"

"If you think I'll obey everything you say, you're mistaken! Just so you know, I won't listen to your picky eating preferences today!"

Oliver angrily shouted and stomped out of the bedroom. From there, Elsa could hear the sounds of him working in the kitchen. She pitied his rough behavior, where his mouth and limbs moved in contrasting ways.

Anyway, putting Oliver aside...

"But, as he said, I don't think it's a good idea for me to get along with her."

"Ugh."

"But if you don't want to leave me... well, do as you please."

While Elsa and Tatiana leaned against each other, Tatiana drew closer, making it difficult to separate. Feeling the warmth of the young girl, Elsa sniffled softly.

The fragrance that slid into her nostrils was the scent of the flower that had become Tatiana's hair ornament. The sweet aroma reminded Elsa of her days at the Featherrun Mansion, of Dorothea's garden.

The day she was bought by Holosseo and taken to the Featherrun Mansion, the day she arrived at that mansion in the "sacred place," the sight that first captivated Elsa's eyes...

"I think flowers are beautiful. But..."

"Huh?"

"Because it reminds me of Dorothea's pitiful death, I dislike them a little."

With narrowed eyes, Elsa gently stroked Tatiana's head with her somewhat outstretched hand.

3
----
From then on, wherever Elsa went, Tatiana was always behind her.

During the day, while Oliver was busy working as a slave trader and absent, it was Elsa's responsibility to take care of Tatiana at his base.

For some reason, Oliver didn't seem to have any intention of selling Tatiana, who was a returned slave, to another buyer. He didn't start reeducating Tatiana or treat her like the other slaves; he kept her at the base just like Elsa.

"You know, it's embarrassing for a slave to return to the seller. It's shameful! I want to do a perfect job as a slave trader. That's why I want Tatiana to recover properly and then sell her to a buyer who will take good care of her. It's a necessary investment."

That's the answer he gave regarding Tatiana's treatment. 

However, in terms of being a returned slave, Elsa fell under the same category as Tatiana.

"As for you... Ah, in your case, I consider various things."

"Should we try reeducation?"

"Actually, I don't remember the first round of education being successful..."

Openly expressing his inability to handle her, Oliver kept Elsa at the base, feeling overwhelmed. Honestly, if he knew she was unmanageable, it would be the right decision to kick Elsa out, but Oliver Zeppes' foolishness was evident in his failure to do so.

Elsa accepted a brief moment of peace, relying on Oliver's small-minded sensibilities.

While Oliver was working, Elsa descended to the white city with the money he left behind and spent time wandering around the stalls of the street market as she used to, accompanied by the young girl.

"You're curious too."

"Ah—."

Elsa and Tatiana walked through the city, both enjoying skewered meat from iron skewers.

Tatiana laughed at Elsa's words and answered with her usual purrs. However, over the past few days, due to the proximity between them, Elsa had started to understand what Tatiana wanted to say, to some extent.

"Do you want more? No, you can't. If you eat more, there won't be room for dinner. It will be troublesome if we upset Oliver and he stops providing meals. We'll have to go through the hassle of procuring food."

"Ooh? Ooh!"

"You're being demanding. Well, I guess I can't help it. Have one more skewer."

Shaking her head vigorously and expressing some kind of appeal, Elsa bought another skewer from the food stall and gave it to Tatiana. For a moment, Tatiana made a hesitant face, but when Elsa took a bite of her additional skewer, she timidly followed suit.

During that time, Tatiana's hand, the one opposite to the one holding the skewer, was constantly grabbing Elsa's sleeve.

"――――"

Elsa, who had been told by Oliver to take care of Tatiana, didn't brush off the small hand grabbing her sleeve. It wasn't bothersome enough to shake off, but she couldn't expose and leave herself defenseless by grasping back. It would be foolish to leave both of her hands occupied.

"The teachings of Featherrun, huh?"

"――?"

"No, it's nothing. I just realized that I tend to forget things."

In response to Tatiana's curious gaze, Elsa recalled her days at the Featherrun estate.

Her memories were faintly blurred―― not due to external factors, but Elsa's own issue with her memory. She was forgetful not only of faces but also of past events.

The only things she could remember clearly were the brutal training with Ornia, the final battle with her sisters, and the surge of emotion when she killed Dorothea――

"I wonder if they will fade away and disappear as well."

The emotions mixed in her murmurs, Elsa herself couldn't quite grasp what they were.

―― About twenty days had passed since the deadly battle with Dorothea, and the situation had completely stagnated. Surprisingly, little had changed since then, and Elsa found herself sinking into the unchanging days.

The misfortune that befell Haken Lexant was likely to be swallowed up by the records of the "Featherrun Sisters", the truth of which would probably not spread widely.

Haken Lexant faced punishment as a result of excessive debauchery―― that was the view of the Gusteko Holy Church and the truth that would be recorded. The "Cursed Doll" who perished within the burning mansion that night would remain unknown to anyone.

"I thought Ornia might get angry, but it seems like unnecessary worry."

After the incident with Holosseo, Elsa had believed that only Dorothea had a strong desire to kill her persistently. So if Dorothea were to be eliminated, there should be no reason for the "Featherrun Sisters" to continue their feud.

However, that opinion ignored Ornia's feelings towards her sisters, about whom she cared deeply.

Therefore, during these twenty days, Elsa had been unusually cautious, anticipating retaliation from Ornia or some form of contact. But the opportunity never arose.

"Maybe Ornia didn't really like Dorothea that much."

"Ah, ah."

"Hmm? Oh, sorry. I was lost in thought for a moment."

For a moment, Elsa was too absorbed in herself, and her response to the sensation of her sleeve being pulled was delayed. Upon looking, she noticed that Tatiana was pulling her sleeve and looking ahead on the road.

Following Tatiana's gaze, Elsa's eyes widened as she realized there was a furry creature curled up in the snowy alley―― it was a dog with black fur.

"Wah!"

Tatiana, who seemed to like animals, pulled Elsa's sleeve and tried to go towards the dog. Sensing her approach, the dog raised its head, and its red eyes met Tatiana's.

――In the next instant, Elsa's iron skewer deeply pierced the dog's left eye.

"――Ahh!"

Without mercy, the dog's eyeball was gouged out, and it recoiled while letting out a cry of pain. Tatiana, witnessing the gruesome scene, was frozen in shock, but the tragedy didn't end there.

The iron skewer taken from Tatiana penetrated the throat of the screaming dog. The black dog fell, coughing up blood from the impact, convulsed for a moment, and then fell motionless. It was a fatal wound.

"Ahh..."

Dumbfounded, Tatiana looked up at Elsa, who had killed the dog. The numerous question marks that floated in her eyes couldn't be answered. Even if there had been room to answer, it was uncertain whether Elsa would have responded.

"I guess it barked at us."

She had failed to finish it off in one blow, allowing it to bark before dying.

If it were just a stray dog, there would be no reason to get worked up over its final sound. However, this dog was not just a stray dog―― it was a hunting dog. Moreover, it was a specially trained hunting dog.

"――Ahh!"

Immediately after, hunting dogs that heard the death knell of their erstwhile companion started leaping into the snowy alley where Elsa and Tatiana were. Trained hunting dogs were incomparable to ordinary thugs. In total, there were six of them, and they all aimed for――, or rather, lunged at Elsa and Tatiana.

"Stay away!"

"Ahh?!"

Confronted with the leaping hunting dogs, Elsa pushed Tatiana to the aside. Jumping over Tatiana, who lost her balance and fell over, Elsa evaded the dogs that bared their fangs as they approached her.

Having exhausted the iron skewer to kill the first one, Elsa had no weapons with which to fight. Therefore, when the hunting dogs aimed for her feet, Elsa leapt high to evade them.  However, she could only dodge the first two dogs like that. She had no way to escape from the remaining four, which closed in on Elsa――

"But that won't work."

The sharp tip of an icy spear pierced directly into the gaping maw of one of the hunting dogs. The hunting dog, splattered with blood, fell to the ground. It was Elsa's makeshift weapon, an icicle she had grabbed, that had dealt the blow.

Using the large icicles hanging from the eaves as improvised weapons, Elsa deftly maneuvered against the growling hunting dogs.

"If you were just wild dogs, you could escape when the odds turned against you. How pitiful you all are."

The trained hunting dogs, forbidden from fleeing, had no choice but to fight to the death. While Elsa pitied their situation, her freezing spears showed no mercy.

The remaining five dogs fought valiantly, but they had no chance of winning against Elsa, who was nearly invincible from the start. Their necks and bodies were pierced by icicles, and one by one, meticulously and thoroughly, their lives were taken, and the pursuit came to an end.

"It's over, Tatiana."

Throwing away the icicles stained with blood, Elsa turned around after extinguishing the breath of the hunting dogs. Tatiana, who had been holding her head during the battle, raised her face at the sound of Elsa's voice, her eyes wide open.

Due to the vicious wounds caused by the hunting dogs' fangs tearing through her, Elsa had bloody and gruesome injuries on her shoulders and thighs.

"Oh, this? Don't worry about it. It'll heal soon enough even if you leave it alone."

"Uuh! Uuh!"

"Hmm? Do you want more skewered treats now? What a peculiar girl."

Shaking her head back and forth, Tatiana expressed the same request as she did in front of the food stall, causing Elsa to tilt her head in confusion.

However, once again, Elsa had no room to indulge Tatiana's hunger.

"It seems like it's started."

Elsa narrowed her eyes, and in her field of vision, she could see black smoke rising in the distance down the alleyway. It was in the direction of Inorandum's main street——the beginning of an incident originating from the area where the food stalls were lined up.

The beginning. Yes, this was the beginning.

"Ah, uuh!"

Along with the black smoke, shouts of anger and screams of the people in the city began to spread. Tatiana's expression was filled with fear upon hearing them, and the girl clung to Elsa's arm.

Allowing Tatiana to cling to her arm as she pleased, Elsa looked back at the slain hunting dogs. Without a doubt, their presence meant only one thing.

"Saria and Hildea. The two of you are next."

----

"――You authorized the purification operation in the 'Hallowed Land,' didn't you!?"

Ornia, with a changed complexion, burst into the office, breaking through the door. Inside the room, there was an elderly man with no eyes, or so it seemed.

"...You're making too much noise, Ornia."

The voice that escaped the old man's throat was too beautiful to be true.

Immediately after, the man's skeletal structure creaked with a sound, and slowly his appearance began to change. The wrinkles on his skin disappeared, replaced by a renewed firmness, and his once faded hair now glowed with fiery colors. After just a few seconds, the person present there was no longer the late Holosseo but Sithonia Featherrun.

She was the eldest of the sisters who, in place of their deceased master, maintained the 'Cursed Doll' mansion.

However, without paying any attention to the transformation of her sister, Ornia approached her aggressively and said,

"Noisy? Noisy, you say? How can I not make a fuss about this!? Saria and Hildea acting recklessly is nothing new! But what are you thinking!?"

"It's always about the sisters, isn't it? You're the same, aren't you?"

"And for that reason, you have no qualms about the purification operation!?"

"Yes, of course. Why are you so surprised?"

Ornia grabbed her collar and pleaded with rough breathing. Sithonia tilted her head in response. Hearing Sithonia's answer, Ornia took two, three steps back.

It felt as if the familiar Sithonia before her had transformed into a different person.

"Isn't it always the same? It's my specialty to become someone else."

"Even if that's the case... no one should be able to control the depths of your heart. And yet, your decision now, it's as if... as if..."

"Holosseo Featherrun. ――As heartless as our father?"

"――――"

In response to the probing words, Ornia answered by lowering her eyes weakly. Sithonia, in response, narrowed her eyes and didn't even attempt change her expression.

Though she didn't want to entertain the thought that, while playing the role of Holosseo, she had been corrupted to share his mentality.

"Even the existence of 'Cursed Dolls,' isn't that an unbelievable story?"

"――Anyway, it was I who granted permission for the purification operation to Saria and Hildea. To eliminate Elsa... that girl, I deemed it the best course of action. Is something wrong?"

"If she were lurking in some small 'Hallowed Land,' I wouldn't object either. But it was in Inorandum... a major Hallowed Land!?"

Inorandum, the 'Snow Field Capital,' was a city built on top of one of the largest 'Hallowed Lands' within the Holy Kingdom of Gusteko. Naturally, its population and significance within the nation surpassed that of any other 'Hallowed Land.'

Originally, it was a land where even engaging in visible combat would be avoided.

And yet, Saria and Hildea plan to carry out—

"—the purification operation."

It is the final measure taken by the Holy Church to eliminate the 'heretics' upon their judgment. It is a forbidden act that removes all restrictions in order to eradicate a problematic existence.

Once it is declared, the targeted land is stripped bare, everything lost.

In other words, Sithonia managed to persuade the Holy Church by some means—though the details remain unknown. She obtained permission to turn a major Hallowed Land into a scorched wasteland, all for the sake of killing Elsa alone.

"Of course, we won't burn down the entire city. It's only the section where Elsa is hiding... Just one out of over fifty sections."

"Even so, the residents must number no less than a thousand."

"Yes, that's true. But if it's necessary to protect our sisters... Hey, Ornia."

As she spoke, Sithonia closed the distance between herself and Ornia, gently touching Ornia's surprised cheek with her lifted hand.

Relieved by this gentle gesture, Ornia held her breath.

The sensation of her fingertips, the caring gesture—everything seemed like proof that Sithonia hadn't changed.

"You care about your sisters. And yet, placing unknown strangers and your cherished sisters on a scale, you value the unknown strangers more?"

"W-Well..."

"If you raise objections to the operation out of concern for a thousand strangers you don't know, that's what you're saying, isn't it? Am I wrong?"

Ornia wanted to say that she was wrong.

However, her mouth refused to move, and she lacked the will to resist Sithonia. Moreover, Ornia's heart was gradually accepting that Sithonia was right.

Indeed, Sithonia is capable of making better choices than thoughtless Ornia.

That's why Ornia and Sithonia divided their roles.

"I will make the right judgment. That's why, Ornia, you..."

"To become the spear for the sisters in order to execute that judgment... yes, that's right."

Nodding slowly, Ornia becomes aware of her own worth and past choices. Then, she looks back at Sithonia and slightly lowers her chin.

"I understand the details. We'll carry out indiscriminate purification operation, releasing all the dogs from the mansion. Saria and Hildea must be serious about this."

"Yes, that's what I expect."

Receiving Sithonia's affirmation, Ornia takes a short breath and turns her back to her sister.

"Ornia?"

"I will move my body underground... I need time to clear my mind in this fog."

With only those words left behind, Ornia exits the office. As she leaves, she places the almost broken door back into its original position and then departs, catching Sithonia's smiling face in the corner of her vision.

Thus, she leaves the office and gradually quickens her pace while biting her lip.

"Everything is for Featherrun, for us sisters to survive..."

Blood flowed from her clenched fist, but she, who no longer felt pain, was unaware of it. There was only one thought in her mind. - Her foolish younger sister who knew pain yet feared no wounds, who didn't hesitate to be hurt.

----

―― Elsa vaguely remembered the gist of the "purification operation."

"I believe it was a sketchy job to gather and get rid of troublesome people, right?"

Although it could be considered a sketchy way of remembering, there were no sisters nearby to point it out in this situation.

If she had delved deeper into her memories, she would have correctly understood that it involved extreme actions permitted to eliminate those who opposed the policies of the Holy King Church and were considered heretics.

In that regard, the roles and objectives assigned to the "Featherrun Sisters" were not significantly different.

However――

"Unlike the task of targeting only specific individuals and their immediate surroundings, here the damage spreads without limits... It seems our opponents can't afford to be complacent."

"Ah! Ah!"

Tatiana desperately tugged at Elsa's sleeve, raising her voice.

She was pointing toward the street where screams and shouts echoed without interruption. She was pleading with Elsa to join the turmoil happening over there.

"Probably, their objective is me. That's why I understand Tatiana's feelings of wanting to sacrifice me to survive..."

"Uuh!? Ah, uuh!"

"Yes, I understand. In most cases, everyone prioritizes his own life."

When Elsa shrugged, seemingly unconcerned, Tatiana vigorously shook her head. She could be a bit too straightforward, but Tatiana, who didn't try to deceive anyone, was easy to deal with.

However, it went without saying that there was a risk in dragging Tatiana around in this situation.

"I don't have a suitable weapon, and it's troublesome. Tatiana, would you be fine if I left you alone?"

"Uuh!? Ah, uuh!"

"That's a reassuring response. In that case..."

Nodding at Tatiana's fearless attitude, unaffected even by the hounds, Elsa considered splitting up with her. However, just before she could inform Tatiana of that, Oliver's words came to mind:

During his absence, she was entrusted with taking care of Tatiana.

"――――"

"Ah! Uh!"

"...It's nice to see you so confident, but we're not splitting up."

Perhaps Tatiana didn't need her help, but Elsa didn't want to be scolded by Oliver. If she didn't continue with her unfamiliar babysitting duties, she might even, at worst, be kicked out.

To avoid such trouble, Elsa decided to go against Tatiana's wishes.

"I'm sorry, but please accompany me, Tatiana."

"Ah!"

"No matter how much you dislike it, it's no use. You'll come with me to alleviate my boredom."

"Uuh!?"

Tatiana protested with wide eyes. However, that was as far as their exchange could go.

In the next moment, numerous figures appeared from the street beyond the alleyway and rushed toward Elsa and Tatiana. It a crowd being chased by dogs, seeking salvation.

All of them were residents of Inorandum with whom Elsa had spent some time. The faces of the uncertain individuals were vaguely familiar or unfamiliar.

"Well, I don't remember them much, so it's fine."

"Au!?"

Muttering softly, Elsa abruptly pushed Tatiana to the edge of the road without warning. Then, she crouched down and leapt towards the front of the fleeing crowd, sweeping her leg with gusto.

"Whoa!?"

A man screamed and fell backward, and immediately after, he was trampled by the people behind him. The screams turned into cries of pain, cries of despair. And as those who trampled the man stumbled over him, one after another, the alleyway turned into a scene of hellish chaos.

Amidst the continuous cries of agony, angry curses, and the voices of weeping women, the roars of the beasts joined in――the fierce growls of hunting dogs that chased the crowd. 

Under the name of the purification operation, the hunting dogs had been given permission to mercilessly bite and kill any visible targets. They exercised their licenses to kill without hesitation, pouncing on the fallen crowd.

Blood and screams filled the air of the alleyway, and the cruel hunting instincts of the dogs were satisfied――

"――Maybe the purification operation was a bad move?"

"――hk."

Immediately after, Elsa shattered the glass of a nearby building and used it as a weapon to slash the throat of a hunting dog.

Apologies to the dogs that were delighted to feast on their prey, but at least as a parting gift for that climax, she sent them to hell one after another.

"I'm not particularly interested in the innards of dogs. I had my fill back when I was at the mansion."

With bare hands gripping the glass, Elsa sneered as she covered her hands in blood. Maintaining that smile, she proceeded to deal with the incoming hunting dogs one by one.

Elsa didn't hesitate to use the crowd as decoys.

It wasn't that she considered her own life important, but...

"That doesn't mean I care about others either."

Throwing the glass in her hand, Elsa caught up with a leaping hunting dog, aiming to avoid it. She forcefully pressed her hands against its open mouth, trying to drive its fangs into her arms.

There was a momentary resistance, and in the next instant, the hunting dog's mouth was torn apart vertically, resulting in its demise. As Elsa turned around, covered in the blood of the hunting dog, it was clear that all the dogs that had rushed to this scene were annihilated.

She had likely killed about thirty of them.

"...Ugh, help...me."

"――? I'm sorry. I'm not a doctor, so I can't help."

She shook off the hand clinging to her leg, seeking assistance. It was inevitable that the person, on the verge of death, couldn't see his surroundings, but did Elsa appear to be a doctor?

"That's just a lack of judgment on your part."

After conveying that, Elsa stepped over the groaning crowd and returned to Tatiana. Tatiana, who had been pushed away, stared at Elsa, whose attire was now stained crimson.

"Ah, ahh?"

"Sorry for taking so long. Don't be angry. I'll kill them faster next time."

While marveling at Tatiana's remarkable courage, Elsa waited for her to grasp her sleeve again.

Now then, there were means to kill the pursuers that kept pressing forward one by one, but that wouldn't resolve the situation before dinner. And Elsa, who wanted to avoid that, felt a need to hasten the conclusion.

And for that, the obvious target was――

"――The main enemies, Saria and Hildea, right?"

Among the "Featherrun Sisters," it was the twins' responsibility to take care of the dogs.

Dorothea took care of the flowers, Ornia raised Elsa, and the twins took care of the dogs. It's unknown what Sithonia was raising. At least, she neglected Elsa in her upbringing.

"I'm sure Sithonia simply didn't have the talent for raising anything."

One's temperament and desires don't often align. In that regard, Elsa should perhaps be grateful that her own preferences and abilities were relatively well-matched.

Since nothing comes to mind immediately, let's express gratitude to Oliver or someone else.

"Anyway, let's go somewhere spacious. The enemies are probably looking for me, so if I go somewhere conspicuous, they'll come out to kill me."

"Ah!? Auu?"

"Don't say such barbaric things. As sisters, we should be able to understand each other. I don't think it's wise to discard negotiation as an option from the beginning."

Still holding onto Elsa's sleeve, Elsa takes the spirited Tatiana with her to the main street. Since she had already killed all the hunting dogs that came from that direction, there wouldn't be any additional pursuers.

Along the way, there were a few people who had fallen and were seeking help, but Elsa had to restrain Tatiana, who wanted to finish them off each time.

"You're quite the spirited one, aren't you?"

With her insatiable desire for eating, sleeping, and killing, Tatiana is remarkably human-like. Elsa wonders how good it would be if she could act without restraint like Tatiana.

Humans tend to be trapped by obligations. Sometimes, it can be terribly bothersome.

"Hey, Saria and Hildea. ――You think the same way, don't you?"

As the view opened up, in a snow-covered square mixed with blood and sobs, Elsa tilted her head. Upon hearing the words from their youngest sister, standing on the platform of the clocktower at the center of the square, where ――even from afar, one could see the magic crystal used to tell time, two shadows lined up.

And the identical twins pressed their faces together.

"Hey, did you hear? Elsa hasn't changed at all, has she?"

"Yes, I heard. Elsa truly hasn't changed a bit."

In this way, Saria and Hildea exchanged faint smiles, confirming eachother's statements.

As always, with the same facial features and wearing the same dress, the two of them were identical in every way. Elsa narrowed her eyes at their unchanging nature and let out a small sigh.

"We haven't changed much, have we?"

"Yes, that might be true. But Hildea thinks otherwise."

"This is what Saria believes. Even though it seems like we haven't changed, it may not be the case."

"Me? Well, it's true that I might have grown taller since I'm still in my growth period, but..."

"No, that's not it!"

Saria and Hildea denied in unison, throwing their negations at Elsa, who was lost in thought over the remark. With their hands still joined, they pointed towards someone here.

And there stood Tatiana, shrinking her shoulders.

"What's wrong with this child?"

"What's wrong? What do you mean, 'what's wrong'? Hildea is surprised!"

"Saria was surprised too. We never expected Elsa to be with someone."

With faces as if they had witnessed something incredibly strange, Saria and Hildea shared their surprise. Then, they looked at each other and...

"—Dorothea was killed, right?"

"——"

Upon hearing Saria and Hildea's words, Elsa raised an eyebrow. Not because she disliked their words, but because she was surprised.

"I'm surprised. You blame me for Dorothea?"

"Is it surprising that Hildea cares about her sister?"

"Is it strange that Saria was concerned about Dorothea?"

"Yes. We thought you two were only interested in yourselves."

That's why if someone were to target Elsa for killing Dorothea, she would have assumed it was Ornia, who cared deeply for her sisters.

"Thank you, when the dogs first appeared, I thought it was some kind of mistake."

"Is that so? But without hesitation, the dogs were killed, and Hildea is grieving."

"Poor Saria, who raised them with care! How pitiful!"

The twins mourned melodramatically, their intentions clear, their targets evident.

The issue remained that Elsa was at a significant disadvantage. Unlike with Dorothea, who she had lured into a perfectly laid trap, this time Saria and Hildea held the initiative in their hands.

To overturn this disadvantage and prevent their fangs from reaching their limits, which wer far beyond those of ordinary people, Elsa had to take action.

In order to do that...

"So, how long are you going to hold hands up there? I don't mind watching from here, but leaving it to the dogs will only result in more corpses, you know?"

"Oh my, saying such things. Hildea, you're getting impatient too."

"Well, well, if you're going to say that, Saria has her limits as well."

As Elsa attempted to bring the twins down from the clocktower, they briefly separated, then embraced again, producing a resounding clap with their hands.

And then...

"—Well then, we'll introduce our special one!"

Immediately after, a menacing roar reverberated through the square—or rather, through Inorandum. It was a double roar, shaking the very ground.

The entity behind the dual roar leapt into the square, kicking up snow with force, approaching the base of the clocktower, right before Elsa's eyes.

Dispersing the snow with its movements, drooling from its two massive mouths, the towering figure glared at Elsa and the others.

"—Grrrr!!"

It was a giant demonic hound with two heads, the Witchbeast "Orthros."

6
----
"---Hk!!"

Facing the roar of the Orthros head-on, Elsa's black hair and dress were greatly disheveled.

Experiencing a pressure that felt like a bolt of lightning up close, Elsa licked her own lips, stroked her goosebump-covered arms, and trembled. Not out of fear, but with an intense emotion.

"Amazing."

"Ah-uuh!?"

In front of Orthros, Tatiana reacted to Elsa's candid comment. While being pulled by Tatiana's struggling, Elsa looked up at the twins on the clocktower.

"To think we had such a creature as well, even though we are sisters, I didn't know."

"Perhaps because we recently became sisters," Saria speculated.

"If you had been friendly with Saria and the others, I might have told you secretly," Hildea added.

"Yes. But since I got to be surprised, it's fine like this."

Elsa responded with a mischievous smile to the twins and held her breath. Then, as a faint chill filled the tense air, the Orthros moved.

"---Hk"

The body of the two-headed hellhound measured at least five meters, even with a conservative estimate.

With a single foreleg, it easily surpassed Elsa's mass, and the destructive power it unleashed at the speed of a gale could reduce a human body to dust in an instant.

Pulling Tatiana, who tried to confront it fearlessly, Elsa barely managed to dodge its front paw by a close margin and leapt back a significant distance.

Each strike from its massive body could be fatal; even being grazed could blow away one's life. However, avoiding its foreleg did not guarantee safety.

"A gaping maw that can swallow me whole in one bite. Troublesome."

Twisting her body, Elsa barely avoided its powerful jaws. However, the sensation of narrowly escaping death was not easily accepted by her heart. Moreover, in the Orthros' case, that anguish was doubled.

Fangs clashed with fangs, their sound, tearing through the air, echoed. And amidst it all, Elsa continued her dance, evading the Orthros' attacks while still holding Tatiana.

Snow fluttered while the two heads of the hellhound danced in the white square, scattering corpses and the critically injured residents. If caught up in its passionate predatory behavior, one's life would be extinguished instantaneously.

However, Elsa couldn't sustain her emergency evasive maneuvers indefinitely. Moreover, the two assassins, Saria and Hildea, were not silently observing the battle.

"There you go!"

The voices of the twins overlapped as they shouted to Elsa, who dodged the Orthros' bite in mid-air. In an instant, cutting into the edge of Elsa's field of vision, was the spinning blade of death—Saria and Hildea's strike, rotating harmoniously from their signature weapon the Crescent Moon Blade.

"――Huh!"

Quickly, Elsa used one of the corpses scattered on the square. She kicked up the corpse ravaged by the hunting hounds, using it as a shield against the strike of the Crescent Moon Blade. Of course, the attack was not weak enough to be stopped by a corpse. The corpse split in two instantly.

However, seizing upon the momentary delay, Elsa threw herself into the gap of death between Orthros' fangs and the Crescent Moon Blade, gliding along the snowy streets to secure her survival.

"Finally coming down, huh? Is this the real deal?"

"Well, Hildea is impressed by Elsa's endless chatter."

"Yes, Saria is impressed by her sore loser tendencies too."

The twins continued to mock Elsa, their figures blurred in the snow as they rotated.

However, their smiles were not just an empty bluff. They were directed at Elsa, who bled profusely from wounds on her shoulders, waist, and those she couldn't completely avoid without paying with her own life.

"Ah! Ouch!"

"...Don't get so angry. You're aware of how pathetic you look."

Tatiana, unrelenting, mercilessly slapped Elsa's wounds with both hands, expressing her indignation. While enduring Tatiana's scolding, Elsa kept a close eye on the gaps in the enemy's offense and defense.

The incompatibility between the vast square and the Orthros, who fully utilized its size, made it impossible to grasp the situation rationally. And with the addition of the twins' unorthodox attacks, it became even more impossible.

"But I've also gotten used to your weight."

"Uuh! Uuh!"

"Yes, it won't go so smoothly next time."

Despite being struck at her wounds repeatedly, Elsa nodded to Tatiana, who had become her baggage. It was true that having her arms occupied was inconvenient, but leaving Tatiana defenseless was out of the question.

If anything were to happen to her, she could imagine Oliver's angry face. That's why she would do her best.

To Elsa, who reached an unexpected conclusion, Saria and Hildea sneered with high-pitched voices.

"Hey, did you see? Did you hear? Elsa, she's acting strange!"

"Yes, I saw, I heard! Elsa is such an unyielding girl!"

High-pitched laughter, but it wasn't praise for Elsa despite its content. On the contrary, it stemmed from pity and condescension towards Elsa.

Elsa wondered where their confidence came from――

"Poor Elsa, how pitiful you are! Let me enlighten you, for your sake."

"It's inevitable.  You had no chance of winning from the beginning, foolish Elsa!"

"――――"

"Because having weaknesses is exactly what that means!"

As they spoke, each supporting the Crescent Moon Blade with one hand, Saria and Hildea indicated something with their intertwined hands. It was the clocktower they had just jumped down from.

Elsa followed the direction their hands pointed with her gaze and realized it, sealing her lips as she lost her calm composure.

Because――

"――Oliver."

There, Oliver, beaten, kicked, and in a tattered state, was hanging. He was barely breathing in his suspended state. From the swelling of his face and the dirt on his clothes, it was evident that he had undergone severe torture.

With clear malice and hostility, Oliver had been mentally and physically harmed and captured.

"Aah! Uuh!!"

Upon noticing the same thing, Tatiana's eyes widened, and she screamed desperately with an intense expression. She grabbed Elsa's black hair with her small hand and pointed at Oliver, pleading.

She pleaded for Oliver to be freed, to be rescued.

"I've never heard of a slave trying to save a slave trader."

"Aah!"

"But, well, it's true. Oliver is an irreplaceable eccentric, so it would be troublesome if he were gone."

Listening to Tatiana's plea, Elsa moistened her lips with her tongue.

If he were already dead, there would be no saving him. But if he still had breath, she could rescue him. Besides, there might be another opportunity to hear Oliver's annoying nagging. For that reason...

"Elsa, why do you think Hildea and the others chose this town for their purification operation?"

"Elsa, who do you think told Saria and the others that you were here?"

Just as Elsa was about to take a step forward, the twin beasts, accompanied by the demonic and hunting dogs, interjected. Elsa furrowed her brow, trying to discern the intention behind their statements.

That momentary pause could be fatal—no, it wouldn't be fatal for Elsa.

However...

"――――Aaargh!!"

"Aaahhhhh!"

Witnessing Elsa's arm being torn apart accompanied by a roar, Tatiana let out a scream.

Though it wasn't fatal, it resulted in her losing her arm.

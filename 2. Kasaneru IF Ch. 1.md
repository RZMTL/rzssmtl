"───"

In response to Echidna's statement, Subaru narrowed his eyes with a sense of seriousness.

Deep within him, the muttered words were a kind of acceptance, saying, "As expected."

"If it's someone else's story to begin with, then it's only natural to differentiate and distinguish. I don't think my thoughts are particularly surprising."

Echidna spoke calmly, as if she knew it and it was common knowledge. Subaru twisted his cheek and stared at her with a visible sense of distrust.

"Originally, I had my doubts about that possibility. If he could smell the lingering scent of the Witch, his attitude should worsen right after 'Return by Death,' immediately after I come out of the graveyard."

"However, even after going through multiple 'deaths,' you, who have become more steeped in miasma, come out of the graveyard with your beloved girlfriend, and Garfiel's attitude remains unchanged. In other words..."

"At that point, he hasn't noticed my scent. That's why his attitude doesn't change."

"Excellent answer."

Snapping her fingers, Echidna affirmed Subaru's conclusion.

It was as if she was behaving like a teacher or mentor, but any annoyance towards that aspect was ignored in this situation. What mattered now was that Subaru's doubts had been confirmed, which was more significant.

Someone other than Garfiel can detect the Witch's miasma emanating from Subaru. In other words, Garfiel's antagonism towards Subaru is influenced by the advice of that someone.

And there is no need to think twice about the candidate who provided that advice.

"You must have had an idea all along, right? If you don't avert your eyes."

"...It's Ryuzu, isn't it?"

Echidna's rhetoric had been consistently blocking Subaru's escape routes. This coercive skill of pushing him forward was of a different nature to Rem's.

It wasn't as severe as Rem's, but it was cunning.

"And it's not kind, and it's dark, and the taste is bitter..."

"Are you talking bad of me, by any chance?"

Ignoring Echidna's seemingly offended expression, Subaru furrowed his brow.

If there were someone who could sniff out the lingering scent of the Witch surrounding Subaru and give advice to Garfiel, then, by process of elimination, it could be none other than Ryuzu.

While Rem possessed the same characteristic, it was evident from their past days that her sister, Ram, did not.

Moreover, it is unthinkable for those in positions supporting Emilia, such as her or Roswaal, to be hostile.

The only remaining wild card within a multitude of wild cards was Otto, who had a potential obsession with the scent of the Witch, but...

"...He was killed right in front of me."

Recalling it was suffocating, but Otto was an incorrigible idiot who had proven himself willing to sacrifice his life for Subaru despite their short acquaintance. Therefore, naturally, he was excluded from being a mastermind candidate.

"Before, I was summoned and held captive by Garfiel and Ryuzu."

It was a result of their conspiracy, and Subaru had thought Garfiel was the mastermind. But that was wrong. ── The mastermind was Ryuzu, and Garfiel was her accomplice.

And the reason why Ryuzu took such actions...

"She was able to sniff out the scent of the Witch."

"She conveyed that information to the trustworthy Garfiel. As a result, Garfiel's attitude underwent a drastic change when he wholeheartedly believed his grandmother's story and bared his fangs at you. Quite literally."

"───"

Waving her raised finger, Echidna affirmed Subaru's inference.

With that explanation, the lingering dark cloud within Subaru's mind receded. However, another dark cloud immediately loomed over. It seemed evident in his expression, prompting Echidna to tilt her head and say, "Oh?"

"You seem to have an unsettling look in your eyes. Do you have something to say to me?"

"Of course I do! Based on your earlier tone, it seems like you've known all along that Ryuzu-san was my true enemy! And yet..."

"Why I remained silent about it, I suppose. I understand why you'd be angry, but I do have my own perspective and reasons. I believe it's not too late to hear them now."

"──Fine, go ahead and talk."

With gritted teeth, Subaru confronted Echidna, who placed her finger against his forehead. While the touch of her slender finger didn't diminish his determination, Subaru assumed a posture of listening.

While keeping her finger pressed against Subaru's forehead, Echidna prefaced with, "Listen carefully,"

"Earlier, I touched upon the issue of the miasma surrounding you, didn't I? As long as you are contracted with me, the miasma will never fade away from you. With each use your authority, the miasma becomes more intense, and it's already impossible to restore the other person's impression of you."

"...Ah, right, that's what we talked about. And how does that relate to you keeping quiet?"

"You're impatient. In other words, regardless of what I say, I couldn't change the impression the other party had... I want you to understand that premise."

Though it was a roundabout way of speaking, it was a preparatory explanation to justify her own judgment.

Still with her finger pressed against his forehead, Subaru silently urged Echidna to continue speaking. If the excuses continued like this, Subaru was prepared to reconsider their contract.

"...That is extremely frustrating for me."

It was as if she had read Subaru's inner thoughts, and Subaru's eyes slightly widened in response.

Smiling at Subaru's reaction, Echidna shrugged her shoulders and said, "It's not a difficult concept."

"As a major premise, let's call the other party... for convenience, let's go with Ryuzu. The negative impression Ryuzu has of you cannot be changed. Therefore, as long as she remains an enemy, it's unavoidable for Garfiel to also become an enemy... Are you following so far?"

"...Go on."

"In other words, paradoxically... if Ryuzu doesn't become an enemy, there would be no reason for Garfiel to be antagonized. That's the essence of the argument."

Echidna organized the issue in front of her as if explaining a simple theory.

Certainly, on a logical level, Echidna's explanation made sense. If it is Ryuzu who can sense the lingering scent of the Witch and her advice to Garfiel is the reason for their antagonism, then the best course of action to avoid conflict with the "Sanctuary" is for Ryuzu not to perceive Subaru as an enemy in the first place.

"But understanding the logic doesn't solve everything. According to what you're saying, the Witch's scent that's deeply ingrained in me won't fade or disappear. So, there won't be a reason for them not to dislike me..."

"That's right. They will continue to dislike you... but that alone is not an absolute reason for enmity."

"What do you mean?"

As Echidna's words seemed to dismantle the previous premises, she withdrew her finger from Subaru's forehead and playfully flicked it in front of his nose.

Instantly, a white cup appeared on the tidy table, emitting steam and fragrance that reached Subaru's nostrils.

Each time he returned to the Dream Castle, he was treated to a tea set, the "Dona Tea."

"What's your intention?"

"Didn't I tell you? I'm not just preparing tea as a mere pastime. Asking you to sit at the table is not just for the sake of aesthetics."

"I thought you had a fetish for making people drink your bodily fluids..."

"In reality, I don't feel bad seeing you reluctantly drink tea, but that's not the point. Before making a contract with me, you talked with Ryuzu about... the Apostle."

As Echidna mentioned the "Apostle" and her black pupils flickered, Subaru's breath caught in his throat.

As Echidna said, Subaru had to trace back to a time before his contract with her and before experiencing ten deaths, in order to recall hearing that word.

In the "Sanctuary", which had been engulfed in the shadow of the Witch of Envy, before Subaru seized the opportunity for self-destruction through Echidna's scheme, he witnessed numerous Ryuzus—replicas of her—accompanying Garfiel. 

And he learned that the original Ryuzu was called "Ryuzu Meyer," and that the Ryuzu he knew was one of those replicas, a part of the system that protected the "Sanctuary."

The term "Apostle" was something he heard during his conversation with Ryuzu at that time.

"Have you remembered? Ryuzu should have told you. The tea you're being served..."

"...Is meant to qualify me as the Apostle of Greed."

"And Garfiel also gained authority over the duplicates under the same conditions."

"───"

Echidna's added words fit together in Subaru's mind.

Click. Like gears fitting together with a sound, Subaru felt as if he understood the witch's intentions and the subsequent words. The tea was meant to grant Subaru the power of the Apostle of Greed.

There were likely other preparations as well, but Subaru decided to overlook them for now. What mattered in this moment was that fact and the fact that Echidna had overlooked his ten deaths.

Why did Subaru have to go through those ten deaths?

The reason was──

"I had to wait until the influence I had over the Ryuzus surpassed that of Garfiel."

"That's another excellent answer."

Echidna clasped her hands in front of her chest, her voice filled with delight.

"When there are two Apostles, the coercive power of commands depends on their quality. Garfiel challenged the graveyard and has been an Apostle for a decade... He's more experienced as an Apostle than you might think. If you tried to compete with Garfiel in a short period of time..."

"Repeatedly making me drink tea is the best way... But does that actually work?"

"Oh, are you worried considering your 'deaths'? Don't worry, my interference accumulates in your soul. It will persist even across death."

"...You chose not to explain this in order to avoid dampening my motivation, right?"

Subaru muttered with frustration, and Echidna silently embraced her own elbow. A faint smile appeared on her lips, quietly affirming Subaru's words.

During Subaru's ten deaths, Echidna concealed the truth about Garfiel and Ryuzu's relationship. The reason was that there was no other way to deal with it until the effects of the tea took hold.

─In other words, Subaru had no other choice but to go through those deaths.

"Do you understand and accept it?"

Echidna leaned in, peering into Subaru's face, furrowing her brow and biting her lip.

The slight drop in tone and the way she lowered her voice in a coquettish manner while looking down at him enhanced his frustration, but it didn't escalate into anger. In reality, Echidna's thinking was accurate.

─It's hard to imagine being told to die ten times without protest.

"It was necessary to make me understand even when facing an inescapable deadlock."

"Yes, yes, that's right. I thought you would understand."

"Pinpon. Your likability score has decreased."

"Oh?

Upon hearing the heartless announcement, Echidna's eyes widened in surprise. Witnessing the Witch's reaction up close, Subaru swiftly gulped down the additional cup of tea on the table.

Although steam rose from the cup, he felt no heat. The tea was flavorless and odorless, a mysterious concoction of unknown ingredients.

Subaru was astonished by how the Witch's scheme left no room for waste. Even the ten deaths he had endured and the revelation during this tea party, everything had a purpose.

"So, you've revealed the truth. That means the time has come... Is that it?"

"Yes. From what I've observed, your authority as my Apostle surpasses Garfiel's. If you command it, the replicas who serve as the guardians of the Sanctuary cannot defy you. Even with Garfiel's orders, it is impossible for them to defy you."

"───"

Being referred to as the guardian of the Sanctuary, Subaru couldn't help but feel a hint of irony.

Originally, that role should have belonged to Garfiel. However, Echidna, the creator of the Sanctuary, recognized Ryuzu as the true guardian, not him.

As proof of that, Garfiel would be left out in the cold from now on.

"The scent of the Witch... If Garfiel can no longer hear about the miasma from Ryuzu, he will have no active reason to oppose us."

"Of course, he still fundamentally doesn't desire the liberation of the Sanctuary."

"...If there is room for discussion, there is a way to handle it."

The biggest problem with Ryuzu's actions was depriving Subaru of the opportunity for dialogue with Garfiel.

If violence wasn't used against him without question, and if he wasn't held captive, there were options available.

That's precisely why it would be good to tell Garfiel the decisive reason why he couldn't remain in the Sanctuary.

For that purpose──

"You have a keen eye. Even as a 'Witch,' I can't help but shudder."

Having seemingly read Subaru's thoughts, Echidna sneered and picked up a crystal from the table, a magic crystal, extending it toward Subaru.

She aimed to ensure that not even a fragment of Subaru's experiences as a contractee would be overlooked.

"Now, the situation is prepared. Moreover, opportunities are limitless. With your abilities, accumulate every possible experience, again and again and again──let's seize our desired world."

Yes, the "Witch of Greed" unrelentingly pushed Subaru's hesitant back forward.

5
----
--Unfortunately, the situation proceeded smoothly according to Echidna's expectations.

"I am Ryuzu Shima... one of the first four clones of Ryuzu Meyer, a failure who had her role taken away."

Ryuzu, dressed in white and hidden in the forest, raised both hands in resignation as Subaru found her.

Finding her was easy. He simply gathered the clones placed throughout the Sanctuary, led by Pico, and commanded them.

--Find the clone secretly meeting with Garfiel.

And the eyes of the Sanctuary that Garfiel proudly spoke of easily found the target and revealed her whereabouts to Subaru.

"Shima... the Ryuzu I know introduced herself as Ryuzu Bilma. So, does that mean you divided yourselves by surname?"

--...

"Answer me."

--Yes. We are beings derived from Ryuzu Meyer. Therefore, we cannot change being Ryuzu. That's why we sought individuality in different aspects.

For a moment, Shima hesitated at the edge of speaking but answered Subaru's inquiry.

Ignoring the emotional aspect and making her respond was a privilege of the "Apostle of Greed." The right to command clones forcefully made Shima talk.

"Let me call you Shima instead of Ryuzu-san. It's true that you can sense the miasma I'm enveloped in, right?"

--Hmm...

"Please, don't deceive me. I don't want to keep ordering you to speak your true feelings every time. Ordering someone you know to do something only wears down your heart."

Seeing Shima hesitate in her response, Subaru pleaded with her.

Calling Shima an "acquaintance" may not be entirely accurate, but she was identical to the other Ryuzu Subaru knows—Ryuzu Bilma.

It didn't feel good to twist someone's true intentions and make her comply. It was no different from brainwashing or coercion in its cunning nature.

"...That's correct."

Shima nodded in response to Subaru's brief question, as if she understood his anguish.

Finally, one burden was lifted off Subaru's shoulders. It felt like a ray of hope had emerged in his dealings with Garfiel, which had made no progress until now.

"Shima-san, were you planning to join Garfiel and deliver that message later? Can you please stop that? I don't want to strain my relationship with him."

"...Even if you say that, if Garf requests it, I can't refuse."

"Is that really the case? Even if I ask you?"

"..."

Upon receiving his repeated inquiries, Shima, who had been cunningly composed until then, showed signs of tension for the first time.

Perhaps the previous composure was due to resignation. Subaru's words directly interfered with the calm sea of Shima's state of mind.

"Could it be, Su-bou, that you awakened as the Apostle of Greed in just half a day...?"

"If you're asking whether I awakened, then reluctantly, yes. Can I lie to Garfiel using the power of my words?"

"Probably, there should be no problem."

Reluctantly, Shima lowered her gaze and reluctantly nodded in response to Subaru's question.

A sense of relief for skillfully navigating her response and a guilt for imposing something on her welled up simultaneously.  It was bitter and left a bad aftertaste, as if Subaru had suffered a self-inflicted wound.

However, that was the extent of the harm inflicted upon Subaru. He had to suppress it and move forward.

"Pico, come here."

Closing his eyes tightly, Subaru called out to the figure behind him, suppressing his hesitation.

Then, from within the thicket, appeared a silent Ryuzu—a clone. It was one of the empty dolls scattered throughout the Sanctuary, capable of following instructions but lacking any real substance.

"If Shima doesn't interfere, there shouldn't be any sudden outbursts from Garfiel to worry about. However, we'll still have some people take turns keeping an eye on him."

"As for Suu-bou and Gar-bou..."

"He's currently my greatest hypothetical enemy."

Subaru gave clear instructions to Pico, cutting off Shima who seemed to have something to say. It was an honest expression of Subaru's utmost sincerity.

Of course, Shima might have her own perspective. Subaru himself had experienced nearly twenty "deaths" and had interacted with Garfiel in this Sanctuary.

Based on those experiences, Subaru understood well enough that Garfiel wasn't a monster they could never understand. He knew.

But even so...

"...I've already made my decision on what should take priority. Don't mistake that."

Under Subaru's unwavering gaze, Shima closed her mouth and bowed her head.

He hadn't commanded her to be silent or to not defy him. It was simply that she keenly felt the determination in Subaru's resolve.

In Subaru's mind, separate from Shima before him or his conflict with Garfiel, a voice resurfaced.  It was a voice different too from the "Witch" with whom he was cooperating. Subaru recalled the words spoken by a different person, a terrifying man in a world painted with blood, white snow, and flames.

That man had sneered and gambled with his own life at stake to leave a curse on Subaru.

"You know, Subaru-kun... if you have something important, if something is truly, truly the most important thing for you, strip away everything else. Let go of everything else, and focus only on protecting that one precious thing. If you do that..."

"...You, too, can become like me."

"I...!!"

The voice resounded clearly in his mind, causing his anger to tremble through his throat.

His vision turned completely red, and the sound of his heartbeat became absurdly loud. His breathing became irregular, and unable to bear it any longer, Subaru fiercely struck his fist against a tree trunk.

"S-Suu-bou...?"

Startled by Subaru's sudden outburst, Shima timidly called out to him.

From the frightened tone of her voice, Subaru became aware of his own instability, and, while placing his hand on his forehead, answered, "Sorry..."

Throbbing pain pulsed as if inside his skull. That pain, too, wouldn't let him forget those unsettling memories akin to nightmares. No, he must not forget.

It was a warning. That curse was the binding chain that Subaru himself must consciously bear.

"Please don't misunderstand, Shima-san. While it's true that I consider Garfiel as a theoretical adversary, I don't have any intention of eliminating him."

Subaru said so while grimacing from a headache. Shima widened her eyes in response, leaning forward and asking, "R-Really?"

In acknowledgment, Subaru nodded and said, "However, I need your cooperation to peacefully keep him at a distance. Convincing him is going to be a tough task. Shima-san understands that, right?"

"Well... Garf's stubbornness is deeply ingrained. But how are we going to do it?" Hearing the desire for a peaceful resolution, Shima showed her willingness to go along with Subaru's plan. Accepting her response positively, Subaru moistened his lips with his tongue.

He didn't intend to scheme or deceive with false intentions. He genuinely wanted everyone involved in this situation to understand his thoughts through his words.

If possible, he wished for an outcome that would satisfy everyone involved in this situation.

By doing so, he could prove it, that Natsuki Subaru, having accumulated enough...

"Roswaal, I am different from you."

He would never become a being like that, who clings to only one thing and sacrifices everything else, accepting a world like that.

Even if he were to take the hand of a "Witch," he wouldn't lose his humanity and integrity.

That's why...

"I won't become like you."

6
----
With the cooperation of Ryuzu Shima and the twenty-one clones who followed her instructions, by using the power of the "Apostle of Greed" and skillfully manipulating them, the complex and tangled situation was easily unraveled, and light shone through the dark clouds.

For Subaru, who had been drowning, as if his head were being held underwater, it was a breath of air that he could finally take in, a level of emotion like that.

However...

"Gaaaaah!!"

With a scream that spewed blood, claws swung, and a cruel scene of life being torn apart unfolded, contradicting that divine light that shone through the black clouds.

"..."

In front of Subaru, a small figure, with arms crossed, could be seen swiftly moving hither and thither in his field of vision.

It was the figure of Garfiel Tinsel, the golden-haired boy, literally exerting all his strength as he fiercely challenged the white threat surging like a haze from all directions.

"Shiiii!"

Roaring, swinging claws and fangs, he defeated the enemies that attacked from all sides one after another.

──What else could you call this besides a majestic figure?

Fighting against the enemy all alone and without the support of allies was proof of Garfiel's courage, demonstrating his resolve to fight despite the odds stacked against him.

His posture engraved his nobility and bravery more eloquently than words ever could.

In fact, Subaru had no choice but to honestly reassess and acknowledge Garfiel, whom he had underestimated.

However...

"Tzzz!"

A fang pierced his right calf, causing Garfiel's throat to groan in pain.

It was an incarnation of gluttony, instantly tearing through the trained muscles of his leg and chewing to satisfy its insatiable appetite. Its round body was cleaved in half by a downward hand strike.

However, even if he took the enemy's life, it wouldn't alleviate his pain.

The opponents were literally overwhelming in number, enough to fill Garfiel's field of vision.

"This... This can't be a joke!"

For a moment, a hint of weakness flashed in his emerald eyes, but it was only fleeting.

Suppressing any signs of weakness that emerged within himself, Garfiel, barking fiercely, raised his leg spraying blood and slammed it forcefully into the ground.

Immediately after, the trampled earth flipped up, and a wave of destruction engulfed the white horde.

In one fell swoop, dozens of victories—whether they were beasts or not, it would not be strange for them to be terrified and realize their disadvantage.

"With this..."

Naturally, Garfiel, who witnessed it, also gnashed his fangs at the impact of his blow.

It was a result to be proud of. Perhaps he felt a surge of confidence that they could repel the enemy. However, it was naught but an illusion.

"────Aghh!"

Swarming over the corpses of their own kind killed by Garfiel, the mass of white fur moved.

Simultaneously, like waves approaching the shore without hesitation, the billow of witchbeasts surged forth. Unchanging in their calm, they emitted an annoying screech that grated on the ears.

Without any recognition of the deaths of their comrades or fear towards Garfiel who defeated them.

With a quiet and cruel sound, "Kichikichi," as they greedily devoured life...

"───"

In the face of that posture, even Garfiel's stalwart profile showed a hint unease.

It would be malicious to comment on where his previous heroic figure had disappeared to. This was a level of catastrophe that couldn't be faced rationally.

This is it, Subaru thought.

He had been waiting for the timing to intervene, the opportunity to extend a helping hand, and this was it.

"─It's about time you realize how dangerous the opponent is, Garfiel."

"─Shut up! Shut the hell up and stay quiet!"

However, Garfiel roared, as if brushing off Subaru, who raised his voice to indicate the worsening situation.

It was a voice that rejected Subaru more fiercely than it denied his own timidity.

Before the astonished Subaru, who bore witness to a backlash beyond his imagination, Garfiel, whose deflated heart was roused, used his fists to seize the white mass—the Great Rabbit—and shattered the small magical beasts.

His consecutive punches blew away the fragile magical beasts one by one, but those that flipped over and stopped moving became the fuel for an eternal machine, devoured mercilessly by the fangs of their subsequent brethren.

─No, to be precise, they were not brethren but rather the same existence.

After all, each constituent of the Great Rabbit would tremble and split in the blink of an eye, a mysterious and rapid division of its body. Whether it was cell division or self-replication was uncertain.

The only thing that could be said is─

"That can only buy us time. Dealing with them requires a more fundamental solution."

"That's why I told you to shut up! I won't listen to your orders!"

Confronted with Garfiel's blunt refusal, Subaru could only curl his lips in response.

However, it would be arrogant to simply dismiss Garfiel's stubbornness as mere obstinacy.

In the first place, anyone, regardless of who, who reflected on the circumstances that led him to confront the horde known as the Great Rabbit, one of the Three Great Witchbeasts, would sympathize with Garfiel.

Subaru himself, who orchestrated this situation, was aware of how horribly cunning his own methods were.

"Damn it!"

As if to encourage himself, or perhaps to hate the world, or even to curse Subaru from behind, words of abuse escaped Garfiel's mouth.

It was only natural that he wanted to scream. Subaru grasped Garfiel's inner turmoil with his own hands as if it were tangible.

Subaru himself remembered all too well the overwhelming sense of powerlessness that burned his chest, to the point of making his vision blur.

Caught between a sense of powerlessness and disappointment, that was the terrifying nature of his own personal hell.

At first glance, Garfiel appeared enraged, but in reality, Subaru could only see him as a crying child, overwhelmed by his own sense of powerlessness and disappointment.

And it was none other than Natsuki Subaru's machinations that had forced this awareness upon Garfiel.

"It's impossible for you to do everything alone, Garfiel."

And it wasn't limited to Garfiel alone.

In the face of all kinds of hardships, one person's power is insignificant. That's why, in order to resist the torrent of fate, even if one exerts one's utmost efforts, it won't be enough.

At least, it's not something that can be changed with just one person's life.

"───"

Before Subaru's eyes, Garfiel's valiant struggle continued in vain.

Even if he evaded their claws and fangs, shed their blood and rent their flesh, the Great Rabbit quickly replenished its numbers. It was no mere cat-and-mouse game; it was an overwhelmingly one-sided battle of endurance.

Only one side's endurance was tested, while the other side has inexhaustible stamina.

That's why the Great Rabbit was considered one of the Three Great Witchbeasts and continued to threaten the world endlessly.

"This is as far as it goes."

Tears streamed down Garfiel's face as he clenched his teeth as unhealing wounds multiplied all over his body.

If he took a moment to breathe, it seemed that he could heal the wounds with the healing magic he apparently mastered. However, he couldn't afford to create that time. He must have keenly felt that it was impossible to do it alone.

To make him realize that, Subaru led him to the outskirts of the "Sanctuary" as the Great Rabbit inexorably approached. 

Having achieved his goal, Subaru gave instructions for the clones to act as decoys for the retreat.
